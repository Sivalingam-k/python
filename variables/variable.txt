student_name='siva'
is_pass=True
print('student_name :',student_name ,'status :',is_pass)

#Variable Assignment
--------------------------------------------
#(assignig single value to multiple variables)

Batch09=Batch10=Batch12='PYTHON DEVELOPMENT'

print(Batch09)
#or
print(Batch09,Batch10,Batch12)

#(assignig multiple value to multiple variables)
Name,Age,Course='siva',23,Batch09
print(Name,Age,Course)

# OUTPUT:
# =================

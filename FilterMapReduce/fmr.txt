FILTER,MAP,REDUCE:
========================

==>map,filter,reduce are paradigms of functional programming.
==>map and filter are build in function.
==>reduce ,need to be imported as it resides in the functools module.


syntax:
---------
   FILTER(function,iterable):
      Function-->It tests if each element of a sequence True or Not.
      Sequence-->which need to be filtered , it can be list sets, tuples or containers of any iterators.


-->Lambda Function:

     --> it is an anonymous function(Function without name)
     ->This function can take any number  of arguments but only one expression ,which is evaluated and returned.

     SYntax: lambda arguments:expression

-->map() Function:
====================

     -->map() function returns a map object (Which is an iterator) of the results.
     -->After applying the given function to each item of the given iterable(list,tuple,etc)
     -->or allows you to process and transform all the items in an iterable.
     -->without using an explicit for loop,technique commanly known as mapping.

     syntax:
     =======

         map(function,iterable[iterable1,iterable2.....])
